# Commerce: Online Auction Platform

This project is part of CS50â€™s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript course. it is an implementation of an auction site using Django. The project includes an app called `auctions` that enables users to create, bid, and comment on auction listings. Below is a comprehensive guide to the functionality and specifications of this application.

## Project Structure

### URL Configuration
- The URL configuration is defined in `auctions/urls.py`.
- Predefined routes:
  - `/` (index): Displays active auction listings.
  - `/login`: Renders a login form; authenticates and logs in users upon form submission.
  - `/logout`: Logs users out and redirects to the index page.
  - `/register`: Allows users to register an account.

### Views
- Defined in `auctions/views.py`:
  - `index`: Displays active listings (initially renders an empty template).
  - `login_view`: Handles login via a form (GET and POST methods).
  - `logout_view`: Logs out the user and redirects to the index page.
  - `register`: Allows new users to register and creates their accounts.

### Templates
- Layout and dynamic rendering handled in `auctions/templates/auctions/layout.html`.
- Content is conditionally displayed using `user.is_authenticated` to check login status.

### Models
- Defined in `auctions/models.py`:
  - Includes a `User` model inheriting from `AbstractUser`.
  - Additional models will represent auction listings, bids, comments, and categories.

## Running the Application
1. Start the Django development server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
2. Open the application in your browser.
3. Register a new account, log in, and explore the features.

## Specification
The following features are implemented in the project:

### Models
- **User Model**:
  - Inherits from `AbstractUser`.
  - Extendable for additional user fields.
- **Auction Listings**:
  - Fields: title, description, starting bid, optional image URL, category, etc.
- **Bids**:
  - Tracks user bids on listings.
- **Comments**:
  - Enables user comments on listings.
- Additional models as required for functionality.

### Core Features
1. **Create Listing**:
   - Users can create new auction listings with a title, description, starting bid, optional image URL, and category.

2. **Active Listings Page**:
   - Default route displays all active listings with title, description, current price, and image (if available).

3. **Listing Page**:
   - Displays detailed information about a specific listing.
   - Signed-in users can:
     - Add/remove the listing to/from their Watchlist.
     - Place a bid (must meet criteria).
     - Close the auction if they created the listing.
   - Displays all comments on the listing.
   - Declares a winner if the auction is closed.

4. **Watchlist**:
   - Signed-in users can view and manage their Watchlist.

5. **Categories**:
   - Displays all listing categories.
   - Clicking a category shows all active listings in that category.

6. **Django Admin Interface**:
   - Admins can view, add, edit, and delete listings, comments, and bids.

## Hints and Tips
1. **Database Migrations**:
   - After modifying models, run:
     ```bash
     python manage.py makemigrations
     python manage.py migrate
     ```

2. **Creating a Superuser**:
   - To access the Django admin interface, create a superuser:
     ```bash
     python manage.py createsuperuser
     ```

3. **Forms**:
   - Use Django forms for user inputs (e.g., creating listings, bidding, commenting).

4. **Decorators**:
   - Use `@login_required` to restrict views to authenticated users.

5. **Customizing Layout**:
   - Modify CSS and `layout.html` to personalize the appearance of the site.

## Additional Notes
- Ensure that bids meet the minimum criteria (greater than the starting bid and higher than any existing bids).
- Listings should dynamically update based on their active/closed status.
- Use categories to organize and filter listings effectively.
- Encourage user interaction via comments and Watchlist management.
