# Commerce: Online Auction Platform

This project is part of CS50â€™s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript course. it is an implementation of an auction site using Django. The project includes an app called `auctions` that enables users to create, bid, and comment on auction listings. Below is a comprehensive guide to the functionality and specifications of this application.

## Project Structure

### URL Configuration
- The URL configuration is defined in `auctions/urls.py`.
- Predefined routes:
  - `/` (index): Displays active auction listings.
  - `/login`: Renders a login form; authenticates and logs in users upon form submission.
  - `/logout`: Logs users out and redirects to the index page.
  - `/register`: Allows users to register an account.

### Views
- Defined in `auctions/views.py`:
  - `index`: Displays active listings (initially renders an empty template).
  - `login_view`: Handles login via a form (GET and POST methods).
  - `logout_view`: Logs out the user and redirects to the index page.
  - `register`: Allows new users to register and creates their accounts.

### Templates
- Layout and dynamic rendering handled in `auctions/templates/auctions/layout.html`.
- Content is conditionally displayed using `user.is_authenticated` to check login status.

### Models
- Defined in `auctions/models.py`:
  - Includes a `User` model inheriting from `AbstractUser`.
  - Additional models will represent auction listings, bids, comments, and categories.
